 Determines the next semver version, updates CHANGELOG.md, and bumps package.json for @shellicar packages. Without it, version numbers drift between package.json, CHANGELOG, and tags, and security fixes get wrong semver bump types.

# GitHub Version Management

**Scope:** How to determine the next semantic version and update CHANGELOG.md. Release execution lives in github-release.

Determine the next version number and update CHANGELOG.md for a release.

## Quick Start

```
1. Get current version from package.json or git tags
2. Determine bump type: patch (fixes/deps), minor (features), major (breaking)
3. Confirm version with user via AskUserQuestion
4. Update CHANGELOG.md with new version section
5. Bump version in package.json
6. Stage changes (don't commit - let caller handle)
```

## Scope

- Determine next semantic version
- Update CHANGELOG.md
- Bump package.json version

## Release Philosophy

For npm packages:

- Releases are cheap - release often, especially for security fixes
- Keep releases small and focused
- Multiple PRs can go into one version, but prefer frequent small releases
- Pre-releases available for uncertain features

## Phase 1: Determine Current Version

### From Package.json

```bash
grep '"version"' packages/*/package.json | head -1
# or for root package
grep '"version"' package.json
```

### From Git Tags

```bash
git describe --tags --abbrev=0
```

### From CHANGELOG.md

```bash
grep -E '## \[[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\]' CHANGELOG.md | head -1
```

## Phase 2: Determine Next Version

Based on semver and the type of changes:

| Change Type | Version Bump | Example |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------- |
| Security fix | Patch | 1.2.0 → 1.2.1 |
| Bug fix | Patch | 1.2.0 → 1.2.1 |
| Dependency updates (patch/minor) | Patch | 1.2.0 → 1.2.1 |
| New feature (backwards compatible) | Minor | 1.2.0 → 1.3.0 |
| Breaking change | Major | 1.2.0 → 2.0.0 |

### Pre-releases

For features you're not fully confident in, use pre-release versions:

```text
1.2.1-preview.1
1.2.1-preview.2
1.2.1-preview.3
...
1.2.1  (final release)
```

- CHANGELOG is written as if it's the final version (1.2.1)
- Pre-release suffix is only in package.json
- Increment preview number for each iteration

### Confirm with User

**REQUIRED**: Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to confirm the version before proceeding.

Example options:
- "1.2.1 (patch)" - Recommended version based on change type
- "1.3.0 (minor)" - Alternative if changes warrant it
- "Other" - User provides custom version

The question should include:
- Current version
- Recommended next version
- Reason for recommendation (security fix, bug fix, new feature, etc.)

## Phase 3: Update CHANGELOG.md

### Check if CHANGELOG.md Exists

```bash
ls CHANGELOG.md
```

If not present, skip this phase.

### @shellicar CHANGELOG Format

All @shellicar repos use Keep a Changelog format:

```markdown
# Changelog

## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Section

- Change description
```

**Note on dates:** The date is the planned/expected release date. It doesn't need to match the actual release date exactly - it's more about when the changelog entry was written.

#### Standard Sections

| Section | Use For |
| ------- | ------- |
| `### Added` | New features |
| `### Changed` | Changes to existing features, dependency updates |
| `### Fixed` | Bug fixes |
| `### Security` | Security fixes (include CVE reference) |
| `### Breaking Changes` | Breaking changes (major versions) |
| `### Structure` | Monorepo/project structure changes |

#### Security Fix Entry

```markdown
### Security

- Fixed CVE-2026-25547 in @isaacs/brace-expansion
```

#### Dependency Update Entry

For dependency updates, mention **notable** packages specifically rather than just "all dependencies". Notable means:

- Major version bumps (even in devDependencies)
- Packages users might recognize or care about
- Packages that could affect behavior (runtime deps especially)

**Good examples:**

```markdown
### Changed

- Updated typescript to 5.8, vitest to 3.0
- Updated all dependencies to latest versions
```

```markdown
### Changed

- Updated esbuild to 0.25, tsup to 8.5
```

**Avoid** listing every single package - no one cares about 10+ entries of patch updates. Group trivial updates under "Updated all dependencies" or omit if nothing notable.

**Rule of thumb:** If you wouldn't mention it in a conversation, don't list it separately.

#### Combined Entry (Security + Deps)

```markdown
### Security

- Fixed CVE-2026-25547 in @isaacs/brace-expansion

### Changed

- Updated typescript to 5.8
- Updated all dependencies to latest versions
```

### Update Version Links

Add link at bottom of CHANGELOG (maintain alphabetical/version order):

```markdown
[1.2.1]: https://github.com/shellicar/<repo>/releases/tag/1.2.1
```

Insert after the most recent version link.

## Phase 4: Bump Package.json Version

Use `pnpm version` to bump the version (avoids needing direct edit access to package.json):

```bash
# From the package directory
cd packages/<package-name>
pnpm version patch --no-git-tag-version   # 1.2.1 → 1.2.2
pnpm version minor --no-git-tag-version   # 1.2.1 → 1.3.0
pnpm version major --no-git-tag-version   # 1.2.1 → 2.0.0

# For pre-releases, use explicit version
pnpm version 1.2.1-preview.1 --no-git-tag-version
```

Use `--no-git-tag-version` to prevent pnpm from creating a git tag and commit automatically.

## Phase 5: Stage Changes

```bash
git add CHANGELOG.md
git add packages/*/package.json  # or just package.json
```

Do NOT commit - let the calling workflow handle commits.

## Integration with Other Skills

This skill is **independent and composable**. It can be called:

- **Same PR as changes**: `maintenance-release` → `github-version` → `git-workflow` → `github-pr`
- **Separate PR**: Changes merged first, then `github-version` → `git-workflow` → `github-pr` when ready to release

### Why Separate PRs?

- Work can be done without committing to a release
- Multiple changes can be batched before releasing
- Functionality and version management are orthogonal concerns
- Useful when "not sure if we plan to release yet"

### Typical Callers

- `maintenance-release` - optionally, after verification passes
- Standalone - when ready to release accumulated changes
- `github-pr` - may check if version is known for milestone

## Notes

- Always confirm version with user before proceeding
- Match existing CHANGELOG format
- Security fixes and dependency updates are patch releases (no functionality change)
- Pre-releases for uncertain features: `x.y.z-preview.N`
- CHANGELOG date is planned date, not necessarily actual release date
- For npm packages: release early, release often
