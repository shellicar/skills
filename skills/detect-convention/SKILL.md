# Convention Detection

Detect the project convention and default branch from the current git repository.

## Script

```bash
~/.claude/skills/detect-convention/scripts/detect-convention.sh
```

### Output

Two lines on stdout:
1. Convention name (e.g. `shellicar-config`, `eagers`, `hopeventures`)
2. Default branch (e.g. `main`, `master`)

### On failure

Prints an error to stderr and exits non-zero. The calling skill should proceed without convention-specific rules, or ask the Supreme Commander which convention to use.

### How It Works

The script matches on **both** the git remote URL **and** the working directory path:

| Remote pattern | Directory pattern | Convention |
|---------------|-------------------|------------|
| `github.com/shellicar/` | `~/.claude` or `~/dotfiles` | `shellicar-config` |
| `github.com/shellicar/` | `~/repos/@shellicar/` | `shellicar-oss` |
| `github.com/shellicar/` | `~/repos/shellicar/` | `shellicar` |
| `dev.azure.com/eagersautomotive/` | `~/repos/Eagers/` | `eagers` |
| `dev.azure.com/hopeventures/` | `~/repos/HopeVentures/` | `hopeventures` |
| `dev.azure.com/Flightrac/` | `~/repos/Flightrac/` | `flightrac` |

## Usage

After detecting the convention, load the corresponding `<convention>-conventions` skill for convention-specific rules (branch protection, commit message format, PR format, etc.).
