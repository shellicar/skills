# Azure DevOps Boards

Work items, hierarchy, and migrations. See also `azure-devops-repos` for PR workflows that link to work items.

## When Invoked

If the user invokes this skill, they likely want help with:
- **Planning** new features (where to put them in hierarchy, creating epics/features/PBIs)
- **Managing** high-level items (initiatives, epics, areas, iterations)
- **Creating** work items (tasks, PBIs, features, epics)
- **Querying** work items (finding, searching, listing)
- **Updating** work items (fields, state, relationships)
- **Organizing** work items (hierarchy, parents, iterations, areas)
- **Migrating** work items between projects

Ask what they need help with if not clear from context.

## Work Items

```bash
# Show work item
az boards work-item show --id <ID>

# Query recent work items
az boards query --wiql "SELECT [System.Id], [System.Title] FROM WorkItems WHERE [System.CreatedDate] >= @Today - 7 ORDER BY [System.Id] DESC" -o table

# Query children of a work item
az boards query --wiql "SELECT [System.Id], [System.Title], [System.WorkItemType] FROM WorkItems WHERE [System.Parent] = <PARENT_ID>"

# Create work item (--project is REQUIRED for create)
az boards work-item create --type "Task" --title "Title" --project "<Project>" --area "<Area>" --iteration "<Iteration>"

# Update work item fields (NO --project flag - work item IDs are globally unique per org)
az boards work-item update --id <ID> --fields "System.IterationPath=<Iteration>"

# Update work item title
az boards work-item update --id <ID> --title "New Title"

# Add parent relationship
az boards work-item relation add --id <ID> --relation-type "parent" --target-id <PARENT_ID>

# Remove parent relationship
az boards work-item relation remove --id <ID> --relation-type "parent" --target-id <PARENT_ID> -y

# Add comment (use az rest — no native CLI command for comments)
az rest --method POST \
  --uri "https://dev.azure.com/{org}/{project}/_apis/wit/workItems/{id}/comments?api-version=7.1-preview.4" \
  --resource "499b84ac-1321-427f-aa17-267ca6975798" \
  --headers "Content-Type=application/json" \
  --body '{"text": "<div>Comment text here.</div>"}'
```

### CLI Gotchas

- **`az boards work-item update`**: Does NOT accept `--project`. Work item IDs are globally unique within an org, so only `--org` and `--id` are needed.
- **`--fields "System.Parent=X"` does NOT work for reparenting**: Setting `System.Parent` via `--fields` silently does nothing. You MUST use `az boards work-item relation remove` (old parent) then `az boards work-item relation add` (new parent) to change parent relationships.
- **No `az boards work-item list`**: This command does not exist. Use `az boards query` with WIQL instead.

### Type Changes

When changing work item type (e.g. PBI → Feature), state fields differ between types (e.g. PBI has Committed, Feature does not). **MANDATORY**: After changing type, provide a link to the work item for the Supreme Commander to verify the state and fields are correct before continuing.

**Note**: Azure DevOps supports changing work item types in the UI, but the underlying API is an internal/undocumented Contribution API. When a type change is needed, create a new item of the correct type, then mark the original as Removed with a link and comment.

### WIQL Notes

- **`ORDER BY` restrictions**: `[System.Parent]` cannot be used in ORDER BY — it throws "The specified field cannot be sorted by". Sort by `[System.Id]` or `[System.WorkItemType]` instead, then process results client-side.
- **Path values**: Do NOT use a leading backslash in WIQL. Use `<Project>\Iteration\Path`, not `\<Project>\Iteration\Path`.

### Batch Updates

When updating many work items in a loop, write a shell script to `/tmp/` and execute it (see `cli-tools` skill for why `&&` and `;` are blocked):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e
for id in 100 101 102 103
do
  az boards work-item update --id "$id" --iteration 'Project\Iteration\Path' --org https://dev.azure.com/myorg --output none
  echo "Updated $id"
done
```

## Work Item Hierarchy

Azure DevOps hierarchy (top to bottom):
- **Initiative** (custom portfolio level): The product or strategic programme. The top-level container.
- **Epic**: Business capability domain. Answers "what area of the product is this about?" Vertical swimlane in the capability matrix.
- **Feature**: Long-lived vertical slice capability within an Epic. Accumulates PBIs over time. Cross-iteration by nature.
- **PBI (Product Backlog Item)**: A specific deliverable. The unit of scheduled work, scoped to one iteration.
- **Task**: Implementation step within a PBI.

**Note**: Initiative is a custom portfolio backlog level. Query the project's process to find configured backlog levels.

**Reference**: [Define features and epics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/backlogs/define-features-epics?view=azure-devops&tabs=agile-process) | [Organize your backlog](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/backlogs/organize-backlog?view=azure-devops)

**Visual guide**: See [references/hierarchy-design.png](references/hierarchy-design.png) for a diagram showing how Area Paths (horizontal swimlanes) and Epics (vertical swimlanes) form an independent matrix, with Features as vertical slices and PBIs at the intersections.

### Generating Hierarchy Diagrams

Three scripts generate draw.io diagrams from live Azure DevOps data:

1. **Extract** hierarchy data from Azure DevOps into JSON
2. **Generate hierarchy diagram** — area paths x epics matrix
3. **Generate timeline diagram** — area paths x iterations matrix

#### Step 1: Extract Hierarchy Data

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/azure-devops-boards/output

# Extract → {project}-hierarchy.json
python3 ../references/extract-hierarchy.py --org <org-name> --project <Project>
```

**Options:**
- `--org`: Azure DevOps org name (e.g., `flightrac`) or full URL
- `--project`: Project name (e.g., `Flightrac`)
- `--initiatives`: Optional. Comma-separated initiative IDs or titles. If omitted, discovers all non-terminal (not Removed/Closed/Done) initiatives automatically
- `--output FILE`: Override output filename
- `--stdout`: Print to stdout instead of file

Requires `az` CLI with active login. Walks Initiative → Epic → Feature → PBI via work item relations. Features on the root area path are resolved from their PBI areas automatically. Also extracts iteration dates for use by the timeline generator.

#### Step 2: Generate Hierarchy Diagram

```bash
# Generate → {project}-hierarchy.drawio
python3 ../references/gen-hierarchy.py <project>-hierarchy.json
```

**Options:**
- First arg: Input JSON file (from extract step)
- `--output FILE`: Override output filename
- `--stdout`: Print to stdout instead of file

Creates a **single-page** diagram with Area Paths as horizontal swimlanes and Epics as vertical swimlanes. Features and PBIs are placed in the grid cells. Feature label heights are calculated dynamically based on title length.

**Connected-component grouping**: Initiatives that share area paths are placed side-by-side (horizontal). Independent initiative groups are stacked vertically as separate sections to reduce page width. Uses union-find to detect which initiatives overlap via shared areas. For example, if initiatives A and B both have PBIs in the "Platform" area, they form one section; initiative C with only "easyquote" PBIs forms its own section below.

#### Step 3: Generate Timeline Diagram

```bash
# Generate → {project}-hierarchy-timeline.drawio
python3 ../references/gen-timeline.py <project>-hierarchy.json
```

**Options:**
- First arg: Input JSON file (from extract step)
- `--output FILE`: Override output filename (default: `{input}-timeline.drawio`)
- `--stdout`: Print to stdout instead of file

Creates a timeline view with **iterations as columns** (X axis, sorted by start date) and **area paths as rows** (Y axis). Only PBIs in iterations with start/finish dates are shown. Iteration columns are colour-coded by track (parent iteration path). The legend shows area path and PBI swatches.

#### Full Example

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/azure-devops-boards/output

# Extract (auto-discovers all non-terminal initiatives)
python3 ../references/extract-hierarchy.py --org eagersautomotive --project Uplift

# Generate both diagrams
python3 ../references/gen-hierarchy.py uplift-hierarchy.json
python3 ../references/gen-timeline.py uplift-hierarchy.json
```

#### Installing draw.io Desktop

[draw.io desktop](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop) is required for CLI PNG export. Install per platform:

**macOS** (Homebrew):
```bash
brew install --cask drawio
# Binary: /opt/homebrew/bin/drawio
```

#### Exporting to PNG

Export all drawio files in the output directory at once:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/azure-devops-boards/references/export-png.sh
```

Or export a single file:

```bash
drawio --export --format png --output <output>.png <input>.drawio
```

#### Output Directory

Generated files go in `output/` which is gitignored (`*.drawio`, `*.json`, `*.png`). Open `.drawio` files in [draw.io desktop](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop) or at [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net).

### Hierarchy Design Principles

#### Name by capability, not motivation

Work item hierarchy should be based on **capability areas** — not the reason for doing the work. Motivations change; capabilities don't.

**Bad**: An "Security" initiative with an "APIM Decommission" epic. If the motivation shifts from security to cost reduction or compliance, the hierarchy breaks — the work hasn't changed, but the label no longer fits.
**Good**: A "Platform" initiative with an "APIM Decommission" epic. The platform team owns this capability regardless of *why* it's being prioritised this quarter.

The hierarchy should be resistant to arbitrary business decisions about priorities and motivations. If the driving force changes but the work stays the same, the hierarchy should stay the same too.

#### Epics represent domains, not task categories

An epic should answer "what area of the product is this about?" — not "what kind of work is this?"

**Good**: "Identity & Access" — clear domain that naturally accumulates related work (auth flows, user management, credential rotation)
**Good**: "Decommission legacy API gateway" — goal-based epic with clear scope and a definition of done
**Bad**: "Operations & Maintenance" — task category that becomes a dumping ground
**Bad**: "Backlog" — just means "stuff we haven't organised yet"
**Bad**: "Engineering tasks" — catch-all that avoids the question of where work belongs

The test: *would someone new to the project understand what work belongs here?*

#### Link operational work to the feature it supports

Credential rotation, secret management, and infrastructure changes belong under the feature that depends on them — not in a generic ops bucket. This makes the work discoverable in context. Someone looking at the user management feature should see that it has a Graph API dependency with credentials that need periodic rotation.

#### Active vs Future hierarchy depth

**Active/committed work** must follow the full hierarchy: Initiative → Epic → Feature → PBI → Task. Every level should be present.

**Future/uncommitted work** (ideas, not yet planned) can skip levels: Initiative → PBI is fine. Structure comes when work is committed — don't pre-build Epic/Feature scaffolding for ideas that may never happen.

#### Features are long-lived capabilities

Features persist across iterations and accumulate PBIs and bugs over time. A PBI is an iteration-scoped deliverable within a feature.

- **Feature**: "easyquote link management" — the capability, lives on indefinitely
  - **PBI**: "Rotate Graph API client secrets (2026-02)" — a specific deliverable, scoped to one iteration
  - **PBI**: "Add bulk link creation" — another deliverable in a future iteration

#### Work item ownership by team level

Microsoft's recommended team structure explicitly separates portfolio management from delivery:

- **Management/Portfolio team**: Owns **Initiatives, Epics, and Features**
- **Feature/Delivery teams**: Own **PBIs/Stories and Tasks**

![Microsoft team structure diagram](references/pm-team-structure.png)

**Reference**: [Manage product and portfolio backlogs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/plans/portfolio-management?view=azure-devops)

#### Area path and iteration assignment rules

**Initiatives, Epics, and Features**: Always at **root area path** and **root iteration**.

- These are capability domains and vertical slices — they don't belong to a single system or component.
- Even if all current PBIs under a Feature happen to be in one area, the Feature itself stays at root. Today's "all apples" may become "apples and oranges" tomorrow. Setting the area locks in an assumption that may not hold.
- Iterations are cross-cutting for the same reason — a Feature may accumulate PBIs across different iteration cadences.

**PBIs and Tasks**: Specific **leaf area path** (which app/component owns the code) and specific **leaf iteration** (when the work is scheduled).

- This is where the matrix comes alive: PBIs under the same Feature can have different area paths, and PBIs under the same Feature can be in different iterations.
- The PBI declares what it actually is — which system it touches and when it's being delivered.

#### Epics are business capabilities, not systems or technologies

Name epics after the business capability, not the specific system that provides it. Systems change; business needs don't.

**Good**: "DMS Integration" — the business will always need a dealer management system for accounting, manufacturer reporting, and financial transactions. Whether it's ERA, TUNE, or eventually distributed microservices, the integration epic persists.
**Bad**: "ERA Integration" — couples the epic to today's vendor. When ERA is replaced, the epic name is wrong even though the work continues.

A DMS isn't just a database — it's records, business rules, manufacturer relationships, and financial operations (bank transactions, accounting entries). You can build better front-ends and streamline workflows, but the business backbone needs information flowing into it for the business to function. The epic represents that enduring need.

The same applies to other business systems: CRM, accounting, identity providers. Name the epic after *what the business needs*, not *which product provides it today*.

#### Hierarchy = ownership, not taxonomy

The hierarchy answers **"who is responsible for this?"** — not "where does this sit?"

- **Epic**: Who owns this domain? Which person or team is accountable?
- **Feature**: An aggregation — a grouping of related PBIs under the same owner. Not designed top-down, but emerges from the PBIs.
- **Area path**: What system or component does the work touch?
- **Iteration**: When is it happening?

**The flow is bottom-up through ownership:**
1. You have a **PBI** — the real work
2. You ask **who is responsible?** — that gives you the **Epic**
3. The **Feature** emerges as the natural grouping of related PBIs under that Epic

Don't start top-down by decomposing Initiatives into Epics into Features. Start with the work (PBI), determine the owner (Epic), and let the Feature crystallise as the link between them.

This also means not every Epic needs to be a product capability. A startup (or any business) has real work that isn't building software:
- **Investment & Fundraising** — external/investor-facing
- **Internal Communications** — team engagement and reporting
- **Worker Compliance**, **Security** — operational domains

These are legitimate Epics representing business domains with clear ownership. The board reflects the whole business, not just the codebase. Think of it like assets and liabilities — both are necessary, both need tracking, they're just different sides of the coin.

#### Area paths vs Epics: horizontal vs vertical swimlanes

**Area paths** are *horizontal swimlanes* — the system or application (who owns the code):
- `WebApp` — the customer/dealer-facing web application
- `Platform` — backend services, API gateways, infrastructure, auth, configuration
- `DMS` — code running on dealer management system servers

**Epics** are *vertical swimlanes* — what the business needs (the capability or domain):
- "Deal Workflow" — the core process from deal creation to settlement
- "Finance & Insurance" — a department's vertical slice through the workflow
- "DMS Integration" — connecting to the business's operational backbone
- "Platform Reliability" — keeping systems running, SLAs, monitoring
- "Identity & Access" — authentication, authorisation, user management

**These are independent dimensions** forming a matrix. Area paths define team ownership and where code runs. Epics define business capability regardless of which team builds it. A "DMS Integration" feature might live under the `Platform` area (because the platform team owns the API layer) while serving work defined in the "Deal Workflow" epic. A "Finance & Insurance" PBI might live under `WebApp` (because it's a UI change) while its parent feature is under a finance epic.

### Cross-Team Dependencies

Track dependencies between work items using link types:
- **Predecessor / Successor**: Time-based dependencies (B can't start until A finishes)
- **Related**: General association between related work items across teams

```bash
# Add predecessor link (target must finish before this item can start)
az boards work-item relation add --id <ID> --relation-type "Predecessor" --target-id <TARGET_ID>

# Add successor link
az boards work-item relation add --id <ID> --relation-type "Successor" --target-id <TARGET_ID>

# Add related link
az boards work-item relation add --id <ID> --relation-type "Related" --target-id <TARGET_ID>
```

Supported link types: `parent`, `child`, `duplicate`, `duplicate of`, `related`, `successor`, `predecessor`, `tested by`, `tests`, `affects`, `affected by`.

Dependency lines are visible on [delivery plans](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/plans/track-dependencies?view=azure-devops). You can also query for linked items to find cross-team dependencies.

### Node Name Column

Add the **Node Name** column to backlog views to see the leaf node of the area path (i.e., which app/component). This is useful for identifying team ownership at a glance without the full area path taking up space.

## Iterations & Areas

```bash
# List project iterations
az boards iteration project list --project "<Project>" --depth 3 -o table

# List project area paths
az boards area project list --project "<Project>" --depth 2 -o table
```

```bash
# Create iteration (--path is the PARENT path, --name is the new child)
az boards iteration project create --name "Sprint 1" --path "\<Project>\Iteration\<Parent>" --project "<Project>"

# Create area path
az boards area project create --name "NewArea" --path "\<Project>\Area" --project "<Project>"

# Delete iteration (requires --path, NOT --id)
az boards iteration project delete --path "\<Project>\Iteration\<Parent>\<Child>" --project "<Project>" --yes

# Delete area path
az boards area project delete --path "\<Project>\Area\<Child>" --project "<Project>" --yes
```

### Iteration/Area Gotchas

- **`az boards iteration project delete`**: Requires `--path`, NOT `--id`. The `--id` parameter does not exist for this command.
- **Delete order**: Delete children before parents. A parent with children cannot be deleted.
- **Path format for CLI commands**: Use leading backslash for CLI `--path` args (e.g., `\<Project>\Iteration\<Parent>\<Child>`). This is different from WIQL where you omit the leading backslash.
- **Iteration create `--path`**: Must include `\Iteration\` in the path (e.g., `\<Project>\Iteration\<Parent>\<Child>`), not just `\<Project>\<Parent>\<Child>`. Without it, you get "path parameter is expected to be absolute path".
- **Iteration/area names cannot contain `/`**: Forward slashes are invalid in names. Use `-` instead (e.g., "POC-MVP Bug fixes" not "POC/MVP Bug fixes").
- **State transitions**: Some states cannot transition directly (e.g., Done → Removed). You may need an intermediate state (Done → New → Removed).

## Description Formatting (Work Items AND Pull Requests)

**IMPORTANT**: This formatting guide applies to both work item descriptions and pull request descriptions.

- **Work item descriptions**: Default to HTML. Can be switched to markdown via UI toggle (one-way).
- **Pull request descriptions**: Markdown. Use standard markdown formatting (headings, bullet lists, code spans, etc.).

### Bug Work Items — Different Description Fields

**CRITICAL**: Bug work items do NOT render `System.Description` in the UI. The visible fields are:

- **`Microsoft.VSTS.TCM.ReproSteps`** — "Repro Steps" (the primary description field for Bugs)
- **`Microsoft.VSTS.TCM.SystemInfo`** — "System Info"
- **`Microsoft.VSTS.Common.AcceptanceCriteria`** — "Acceptance Criteria"

When writing descriptions for Bugs, **always use `Microsoft.VSTS.TCM.ReproSteps`** instead of `System.Description`. Content written to `System.Description` on a Bug will exist in the API but will not be visible in the Azure DevOps UI.

Use the same HTML formatting conventions as `System.Description`. Structure Bug descriptions with `<h2>` sections:

```html
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>What the user observed or what went wrong.</p>

<h2>Root Cause</h2>
<p>Technical explanation of why it happened.</p>

<h2>Fix</h2>
<p>What was done to resolve it.</p>
```

### Check Format First

Query the work item to check if markdown is enabled:
```bash
az boards work-item show --id <ID> -o json
```
Look for the `multilineFieldsFormat` field in the output.

- If `multilineFieldsFormat` is missing or doesn't include `"System.Description": "markdown"` → use HTML
- If `"System.Description": "markdown"` is present → use markdown

### HTML Format (Default)

Azure DevOps uses specific HTML patterns. Match these exactly — the trailing spaces before closing tags are intentional.

#### Paragraphs

Each paragraph is `<div><span>text</span> </div>` (note trailing space before `</div>`).
Blank lines between sections: `<div><br> </div>`.

```html
<div><span>First paragraph.</span> </div>
<div><br> </div>
<div><span>Second paragraph.</span> </div>
```

#### Inline formatting

All inside `<span>`:
- Bold: `<span><b>text</b></span>`
- Italics: `<span><i>text</i></span>`
- Underline: `<span><u>text</u></span>`
- Strikethrough: `<strike>text</strike>`
- Font colour: `<span style="color:rgb(200, 38, 19) !important;">text</span>`
- Highlight: `<span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 0) !important;">text</span>`

**Note**: Use `!important` on `color` and `background-color` styles — without it, Azure DevOps dark mode overrides the colours.

#### Lists

Bullet lists use `<span>` inside `<li>`. Numbered lists do not.

```html
<div><span>Bullet points</span> </div>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li><span>First item</span> </li>
    <li><span>Second item</span> </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div><span>Numbered list</span> </div>
<div>
  <ol>
    <li>First item </li>
    <li>Second item </li>
  </ol>
</div>
```

#### Indentation

Uses `<blockquote>` with inline style. Nest for deeper levels.

```html
<div><span>Not indented</span> </div>
<blockquote style="margin:0 0 0 40px;border:none;">
  <div><span>Indented once</span> </div>
</blockquote>
<blockquote style="margin:0 0 0 40px;border:none;">
  <blockquote style="margin:0 0 0 40px;border:none;">
    <div><span>Indented twice</span> </div>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
```

#### Code blocks

Each line is a `<div>` inside `<pre><code>`:

```html
<pre><code><div>line1</div><div>line2</div><div>line3</div></code></pre>
```

#### Mentions

- User: `<a href="#" data-vss-mention="version:2.0,{user-id}">@Name</a>`
- Work item: `<a href="https://dev.azure.com/{org}/{project}/_workitems/edit/{id}/" data-vss-mention="version:1.0">#{id}</a>`
- PR: `<a href="/{org}/{project}/_git/{repo}/pullrequest/{id}" data-vss-mention="version:1.0" data-pr-title="{title}">PR {id}: {title}</a>`

#### Images

```html
<div><img src="{attachment-url}" alt="{filename}"><br> </div>
```

#### Links

Use `target=_blank` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for external links:

```html
<a href="https://example.com" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">https://example.com</a>
```

#### Full example

```html
<div><span>Summary of the feature or work item.</span> </div>
<div><br> </div>
<div><span>Previous work completed:</span> </div>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li><span>First completed item</span> </li>
    <li><span>Second completed item</span> </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div><span>Remaining:</span> </div>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li><span>First remaining item</span> </li>
    <li><span>Second remaining item</span> </li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

### Markdown Format (When Enabled)

If the description field has been converted to markdown, use standard markdown syntax with newlines.

**Note**: Once a field is set to markdown mode, you cannot switch back to HTML. The toggle is one-way.

**Markdown syntax reference**: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/project/wiki/markdown-guidance

### Work Item References in Descriptions

**IMPORTANT**: When referencing other work items in description text, ALWAYS use the rich link HTML format — never plain `#123`.

Plain `#123` does NOT render as a clickable link in Azure DevOps descriptions. Use:

```html
<a href="https://dev.azure.com/{org}/{project}/_workitems/edit/{id}/" data-vss-mention="version:1.0">#{id}</a>
```

**Example** (linking work item 503 in CircuitBreaker):
```html
See <a href="https://dev.azure.com/hopeventures/CircuitBreaker/_workitems/edit/503/" data-vss-mention="version:1.0">#503</a> for the workflow.
```

This applies everywhere: descriptions, comments, and any HTML field. See also [Work Item Rich Links](#work-item-rich-links) and [Pull Request Rich Links](#pull-request-rich-links) below.

### Writing Style

See `writing-style` skill for titles, descriptions, and general tone.

Stakeholders read these titles - focus on what changes from their perspective, not what code you're writing.

## Backlog Priority & Organisation

### Backlog Priority Field

Azure DevOps uses `Microsoft.VSTS.Common.BacklogPriority` (a float) to order items on the backlog. This value is set automatically when items are reordered via drag-and-drop in the UI.

```bash
# Query features in backlog priority order (matches UI backlog view)
az boards query --wiql "SELECT [System.Id], [System.Title], [Microsoft.VSTS.Common.BacklogPriority] \
  FROM WorkItems WHERE [System.WorkItemType] = 'Feature' \
  AND [System.IterationPath] UNDER '<Project>\<IterationParent>' \
  AND [System.State] NOT IN ('Done', 'Removed') \
  ORDER BY [Microsoft.VSTS.Common.BacklogPriority]" -o json
```

### Three Independent Dimensions

Work items are organised along three independent axes:

- **Hierarchy** (parent-child): What capability does this belong to? Initiative → Epic → Feature → PBI → Task. This is the vertical structure — business capability domains (Epics) broken into long-lived capabilities (Features) broken into deliverables (PBIs) broken into implementation steps (Tasks).

- **Area Path** (horizontal swimlane): Which app or component owns this work? (e.g., Admin, Platform, Facilitators, Organisations). Area paths represent the system or application — where the code lives and who maintains it.

- **Iteration Path** (time-bound): When is this being worked on? Iterations are time-bound periods — they may represent different cadences (monthly support, numbered releases, quarterly planning) depending on the project's workflow. PBIs and Tasks are assigned to specific leaf iterations. Initiatives, Epics, and Features sit at the root iteration (cross-cutting).

These dimensions are **independent** and form a matrix. A Platform PBI can be in a Project iteration or a Support iteration. An Admin task and a Platform task can both be under the same Feature. A Feature under a "Subscriptions" Epic can have PBIs in the Platform area. Do not couple area paths to hierarchy or iteration type.

#### Planned vs Scheduled: Two Independent Dimensions

Work items exist along two additional independent dimensions beyond hierarchy and area/iteration paths:

**Dimension 1 — Hierarchy Placement (Planned vs Unplanned)**:
- **Unplanned work**: Future ideas, not yet structured into the Epic/Feature hierarchy
- **Planned work**: Exists in the backlog hierarchy under an Epic or Feature, defining *what* needs to be built and *why*

**Dimension 2 — Iteration Assignment (Scheduled vs Unscheduled)**:
- **Unscheduled work**: Not assigned to a specific iteration, no delivery timeline commitment
- **Scheduled work**: Assigned to an iteration with dates, representing committed delivery

These dimensions are **independent** and create three practical states:

1. **Unplanned & Unscheduled**: Future ideas not yet in the backlog structure
2. **Planned & Unscheduled**: In the hierarchy (under Epic/Feature) but not assigned to iterations — scope is defined but timing is not committed
3. **Planned & Scheduled**: In the hierarchy AND assigned to iterations — committed work with delivery timeline

Any work item type (Epic, Feature, PBI, Task) can be scheduled or unscheduled depending on iteration assignment. Higher-level items (Epics, Features) are often planned but unscheduled, defining capability scope without iteration commitment. PBIs are typically both planned and scheduled when ready for delivery.

**For queries and backlog filtering**: Epics and Features appear on backlogs based on their area path and their children's iteration assignments. PBIs appear based on both area path AND iteration path — if a PBI isn't in one of the team's selected iterations, it won't show on their backlog even if the area path matches.

### Backlog Organisation Workflow

When helping the user organise or prioritise their backlog:

#### 1. Understand the Current State
Query the backlog in priority order for the relevant team/level. Present a numbered list showing: order, ID, title, state, area, parent.

```bash
# Features for a team (use iteration to scope to team)

#### 2. Identify Issues
Check for:
- **Orphaned items**: No parent, or parent in wrong hierarchy level
- **Misplaced area paths**: Area doesn't match the app/component the work is in
- **Bare iteration paths**: Features/PBIs/Tasks at the top-level iteration instead of a specific one
- **Stale items**: Old items still marked as New/Active that should be Done, Removed, or moved to a Future iteration
- **Cross-area children**: Tasks under a PBI where the task's area doesn't match its actual app context

#### 3. Review Priority Order
Walk through the backlog with the user:
- Items actively In Progress should generally be near the top
- Items in earlier iterations (current/next sprint) above later ones
- Dependencies: items that block others should be prioritised higher
- Present the current order and ask if anything needs to move

#### 4. Apply Changes
Use batch update scripts for bulk changes (write to `/tmp/` and execute — see `cli-tools` skill):
- Reparenting: `az boards work-item relation add/remove`
- Area/iteration changes: `az boards work-item update --area/--iteration`
- State changes: `az boards work-item update --state`
- Clearing date fields: `az boards work-item update --fields "Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.StartDate="`

**Note**: Backlog priority (drag-and-drop ordering) can only be changed via the UI or the undocumented Settings API. Use iteration assignment and state to influence effective priority when CLI-only.

#### 5. Verify
Re-query the backlog after changes and present the updated view. Compare with the UI if the user has it open.

### Clearing Fields

To unset/clear a field value, set it to an empty string:
```bash
# Clear start date
az boards work-item update --id <ID> --fields "Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.StartDate="

# Clear target date
az boards work-item update --id <ID> --fields "Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.TargetDate="
```

## Move Work Item Between Projects

Use REST API to move a work item to a different project. Update three fields together:
- `System.TeamProject` - target project name
- `System.AreaPath` - valid area path in target project
- `System.IterationPath` - valid iteration path in target project

```bash
az rest --method PATCH \
  --uri "https://dev.azure.com/{org}/_apis/wit/workitems/{id}?api-version=7.1" \
  --resource "499b84ac-1321-427f-aa17-267ca6975798" \
  --headers "Content-Type=application/json-patch+json" \
  --body '[
    {"op": "add", "path": "/fields/System.TeamProject", "value": "{TargetProject}"},
    {"op": "add", "path": "/fields/System.AreaPath", "value": "{TargetProject}\\{Area}"},
    {"op": "add", "path": "/fields/System.IterationPath", "value": "{TargetProject}\\{Iteration}"}
  ]'
```

**Important**:
- Parent relationships are preserved if the parent is already in the target project
- Move parent items before children to maintain hierarchy
- The resource ID `499b84ac-1321-427f-aa17-267ca6975798` is required for Azure AD authentication

## Migration Workflow

When migrating work items between projects:

### 1. Discovery and Planning
Before migrating, gather the full picture:
- Query all work items in the source, grouped by type and state
- Check what already exists in the target project (area paths, iterations, work items)
- Identify the hierarchy (Initiative → Epic → Feature → PBI → Task)
- Present a summary to the user before proceeding

### 2. Categorize Items
For each item, determine the action:
- **Move**: Item needs to be moved to target project (use REST API to update TeamProject/AreaPath/IterationPath)
- **Recreate**: Item needs a fresh start in the target — create new item in target, mark old as Removed with link and comment
- **Consolidate**: Equivalent item exists in target - mark as Removed with link and comment
- **Done**: Item was completed - leave as Done
- **Remove**: Item is obsolete/cancelled - mark as Removed

### 3. Consider Type Changes
Work item types may change during migration (case by case):
- Feature → PBI (if scope reduced)
- Feature → Epic (if scope increased)
- Epic → Feature (if scope reduced)
- Initiative → dissolve into Area Path (if it represents a product area, not a work stream)

Evaluate each item's scope relative to the target project's structure.

**Note**: Azure DevOps supports changing work item types in the UI, but the underlying API is an internal/undocumented Contribution API — not part of the standard REST API. It is fragile and not practical to use from CLI. When a type change is needed during migration, create a new item of the correct type in the target project, then mark the original as Removed with a link and comment.

### 4. Consider Structural Changes
During migration, evaluate whether the current hierarchy is the right structure:
- **Initiatives as Area Paths**: If initiatives represent product areas (e.g., "easyquote", "10ms"), they should become area paths rather than work items
- **Release-scoped Epics as Iterations**: If epics represent releases/versions (e.g., "v1.5 - Feature X"), the version goes to an iteration path and the work becomes a properly scoped epic or feature
- **"Backlog" container Epics**: Epics that are just unsorted backlog containers should be dissolved — their children become unparented features in the right area path
- **Future sub-areas**: Use a `Future` sub-area (e.g., `Project\Area\Product\Future`) for backlog items that aren't actively planned. This follows the pattern used in existing projects.

### 5. Fields to Preserve
When creating new items in the target project, copy these fields from the source:
- **Title** (may be cleaned up, e.g., removing version prefixes)
- **Description** (check HTML vs markdown format)
- **State** (create as New, then update to correct state)
- **Assigned To**
- **Parent relationship** (set to the appropriate parent in the target)
- **Area Path** (mapped to target project structure)
- **Iteration Path** (mapped to target project structure)

### 6. Per-Item Migration Steps (Recreate)
For each item being recreated in the target:

1. **Create** the new work item in the target project with title, description, area, iteration
2. **Set state** to match the source (items are created as New, update afterwards)
3. **Set Assigned To** to match the source
4. **Add parent relationship** to the appropriate parent in the target
5. **Add Related link** from the source to the new item
6. **Add migration comment** on the source (using HTML anchor format for cross-project links)
7. **Mark source as Removed**

### 7. Process Order
Process by area/product group, one at a time. Within each group, create parents before children so parent IDs are available for linking.

### 8. State Guidelines
- **Done**: Use when functionality is complete — leave these items in the source project
- **Removed**: Use for migrated/consolidated/obsolete items (not Done - Done implies functionality is complete)

## Consolidating Work Items During Migration

When an equivalent work item already exists in the target project:

1. **Check descriptions** of both items. If both have descriptions, ask the user how to consolidate
2. **Copy description** from source to target if target has none
3. **Check `multilineFieldsFormat`** - if source has `"System.Description": "markdown"`, ensure destination also has markdown enabled (this is a UI toggle, not settable via API)
4. **Mark source as Removed** (not Done - Done implies functionality is complete)
5. **Add Related link** from source to target work item
6. **Add comment** explaining the consolidation with cross-project link

### Comment Format for Cross-Project Links

Use HTML format with `data-vss-mention` attribute for proper rendering:

```bash
az rest --method POST \
  --uri "https://dev.azure.com/{org}/{project}/_apis/wit/workItems/{id}/comments?api-version=7.1-preview.4" \
  --resource "499b84ac-1321-427f-aa17-267ca6975798" \
  --headers "Content-Type=application/json" \
  --body '{"text": "<div>Continued in <a href=\"https://dev.azure.com/{org}/{targetProject}/_workitems/edit/{targetId}/\" data-vss-mention=\"version:1.0\">#{targetId}</a> ({Title}) in {targetProject} project as part of work item migration.</div>"}'
```

**Note**: Plain text `#1234` does NOT auto-link for cross-project references. Must use full HTML anchor tag.

### Rich Link Prefixes

Azure DevOps uses different prefixes for different artifact types:

- `#1234` — **Work item** link
- `!1234` — **Pull request** link

When writing these in HTML descriptions, use the appropriate rich link format below.

### Work Item Rich Links

For work items, use a full URL with `data-vss-mention`:

```html
<a href="https://dev.azure.com/{org}/{project}/_workitems/edit/{id}/" data-vss-mention="version:1.0">#{id}</a>
```

### Pull Request Rich Links

For pull requests, use a **relative path** with `data-vss-mention` and `data-pr-title`:

```html
<a href="/{org}/{project}/_git/{repo}/pullrequest/{id}" data-vss-mention="version:1.0" data-pr-title="{PR title}">!{id}</a>
```

**Example** (linking PR 6050 in the Architecture repo):
```html
<a href="/eagersautomotive/Architecture/_git/Architecture/pullrequest/6050" data-vss-mention="version:1.0" data-pr-title="Handle more status.">!6050</a>
```
