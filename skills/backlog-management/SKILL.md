# Backlog Management

**Scope: Workflows for grooming, triaging, prioritising, and capturing new work on backlogs.**

For work item CRUD and CLI commands, see `azure-devops-boards`. For hierarchy philosophy, see `work-organisation`.

## Backlog Priority Field

Azure DevOps uses `Microsoft.VSTS.Common.BacklogPriority` (a float) to order items on the backlog. This value is set automatically when items are reordered via drag-and-drop in the UI.

```bash
# Query features in backlog priority order (matches UI backlog view)
az boards query --wiql "SELECT [System.Id], [System.Title], [Microsoft.VSTS.Common.BacklogPriority] \
  FROM WorkItems WHERE [System.WorkItemType] = 'Feature' \
  AND [System.IterationPath] UNDER '<Project>\<IterationParent>' \
  AND [System.State] NOT IN ('Done', 'Removed') \
  ORDER BY [Microsoft.VSTS.Common.BacklogPriority]" -o json
```

**Note**: Backlog priority (drag-and-drop ordering) can only be changed via the UI or the undocumented Settings API. Use iteration assignment and state to influence effective priority when CLI-only.

## Backlog Organisation Workflow

### 1. Understand the Current State
Query the backlog in priority order for the relevant team/level. Present a numbered list showing: order, ID, title, state, area, parent.

```bash
# Features for a team (use iteration to scope to team)
az boards query --wiql "SELECT [System.Id], [System.Title], [System.State], \
  [System.AreaPath], [Microsoft.VSTS.Common.BacklogPriority] \
  FROM WorkItems WHERE [System.WorkItemType] = 'Feature' \
  AND [System.IterationPath] UNDER '<Project>\Project\FPR' \
  AND [System.State] NOT IN ('Done', 'Removed') \
  ORDER BY [Microsoft.VSTS.Common.BacklogPriority]" -o json
```

### 2. Identify Issues
Check for:
- **Orphaned items**: No parent, or parent in wrong hierarchy level
- **Misplaced area paths**: Area doesn't match the app/component the work is in
- **Bare iteration paths**: Features/PBIs/Tasks at the top-level iteration instead of a specific one
- **Stale items**: Old items still marked as New/Active that should be Done, Removed, or moved to a Future iteration
- **Cross-area children**: Tasks under a PBI where the task's area doesn't match its actual app context

### 3. Review Priority Order
Walk through the backlog with the user:
- Items actively In Progress should generally be near the top
- Items in earlier iterations (current/next sprint) above later ones
- Dependencies: items that block others should be prioritised higher
- Present the current order and ask if anything needs to move

### 4. Apply Changes
Use batch update scripts for bulk changes (write to `/tmp/` and execute — see `cli-tools` skill):
- Reparenting: `az boards work-item relation add/remove`
- Area/iteration changes: `az boards work-item update --area/--iteration`
- State changes: `az boards work-item update --state`
- Clearing date fields: `az boards work-item update --fields "Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.StartDate="`

### 5. Verify
Re-query the backlog after changes and present the updated view. Compare with the UI if the user has it open.
